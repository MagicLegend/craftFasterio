# craftFasterio
An small mod for Factorio which adds research that will enable the player to craft faster. Extremely OP, extremely handy.

Based upon: http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=87&t=12787. Since the original creator was an extreme doosh to me, I couldn't care less if he doesnt want me to port his code to 0.12. I am going to call the code mine now, and put it under MIT licence.

Deal with it.

Ps. Have fun using this mod! Usage is like usual with Factorio mods. Issues can be put under the issues tab on Git! Don't use the forums for that!
